  I'm a Microsoft employee, working on Technology Strategy for large Enterprise account.
  I focus on industry business trends and explain how you can leverage Azure Game Stack & Xbox services.

  I assume that I don't know anything. This is a great habit to do a full knowledge refresh and avoiding bias.
